### Standard TODO Comment Format

1. **Keyword**: Start with the keyword `TODO` to make it easily searchable using IDEs or grep-like tools.

2. **Context**: Immediately follow the keyword with a concise description of what needs to be done. This should be clear enough that anyone reading the comment understands the task without needing extensive context from the code.

3. **Priority (Optional)**: Include a priority tag if your team prioritizes tasks. Common tags include `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, and `LOW`. This helps in sorting and addressing the most critical tasks first.

4. **Date**: Adding a date can be useful, especially if you track when a TODO was added to understand urgency or manage deadlines.

5. **Assignee (Optional)**: Specify who is responsible for addressing the TODO if your team prefers or requires assignments. This can be an individual’s initials or a team identifier.

6. **Issue Tracker ID (Optional)**: If your team uses an issue tracking system, include the ticket or issue number. This helps in linking code directly to tasks or bugs in your project management tools.

### Example
Here's what a well-structured TODO might look like in code:
```bash
// TODO: Refactor this method to improve clarity and efficiency. HIGH PRIORITY. Added on 2023-05-08. Assigned to AB. See Issue #1234
```

### Tips for Effective TODO Comments
- **Be Specific**: Vague comments can lead to confusion. Be as specific as possible about what needs to be done.
- **Keep it Brief**: While details are important, TODO comments should be brief and to the point. Long explanations can be placed in documentation or issue trackers.
- **Regular Review**: Make it a practice to regularly review and clean up outdated or resolved TODOs. This can be part of your sprint review or code refactoring sessions.
